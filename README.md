# Architecture as Code

This repository contains our collection of version-controlled architecture diagrams. The goal is to create a "living documentation" of our systems that evolves alongside our code.

## üéØ Purpose

* **Clarity:** Provide a clear, shared understanding of our software architecture.
* **Onboarding:** Accelerate ramp-up time for new engineers.
* **Collaboration:** Enable better technical discussions between teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling & Framework

* **Tool:** We use [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) for its "diagrams as code" approach.
* **Framework:** We follow the [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) (Context, Containers, Components) to describe systems at different levels of detail.
